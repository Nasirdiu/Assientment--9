    "review": " The Suzuki Gixxer 250 looks macho with the sculpted fuel tank with the extended shrouds at either end. The LED headlamp adds a fresh look to the design, while the split seats, and LED taillight add a touch of sportiness to the motorcycle. The bike also comes with the Gixxer's distinctive dual muffler exhaust as well as brushed finish alloy wheels and a new all-digital instrument console carried over from the Gixxer SF 250.",

    "review": " There is a lot happening in the adventure motorcycle segment in India. Till about a month ago, there was just the Kawasaki Versys 650 as the only option when looking for an ADV having a displacement less than 800 cc. Now you have the SWM SuperDual T and the Suzuki V-Strom 650 XT ABS as well. Speaking of the Suzuki V-Strom 650 in particular, it is one of the highest selling 650 cc adventure touring motorcycles across the globe and is now on sale in India.",
